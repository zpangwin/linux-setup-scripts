# Title

x-distro dot files.

## Description

These are the dotfiles I put in /etc/skel after a fresh install and generally backup/merge/replace my current user's with.

They support being used under root, although I trim things down a bit.

When I say 'x-distro' I mean cross-distro as in it works on "more than one" distro, not that it supports all distros. I don't intend to support all distros. And especially not BSD-variants.

This will likely support whatever I'm using on the various computers in my house and ones that I maintain / advise on.

Currently this includes Linux Mint 19, Linux Mint 20, and Fedora 33/34 (generally aimed for latest stable fedora). I was also testing on LMDE-4 at one point and I believe these should work there as well but no longer test that distro.

I am also considering adding either OpenSUSE or an Arch-based distro to the mix but this has not yet take place at the time of writing.
