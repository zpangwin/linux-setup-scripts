## Description

This adds the official PPA for firejail and installs the latest stable version instead of the old LTS version which has since been deprecated.

## How to install:

*NOTE: This script has dependencies on resources from my repo so it will fail if you just download the install script by itself and try to run.*

To install run the following from a terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/zpangwin/linux-setup-scripts.git;
find linux-setup-scripts -type f -iname '*.sh' -exec chmod a+rx "{}" \;;
cd linux-setup-scripts/mint-20.x/apps/firejail
./install-firejail-from-ppa.sh
```
