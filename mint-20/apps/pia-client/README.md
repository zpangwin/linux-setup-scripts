WIP - this is not scripted yet

PIA = Private Internet Access; a popular and well-vetted VPN provider

currently the pia installer for linux requeries that you do NOT run it as root.

-> need to check for an official ppa
-> if no ppa, download deb file from site
-> anyway to run as root (needed for the purpose of installing in a chroot env for custom live-disc)
