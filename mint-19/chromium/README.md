WIP

This installs chromium but since its available in the central repo that's not that impressive.

The goal here was to consistently get rid of the no keyring prompts when launching chromium.
this may or may not actually do that (when i tested in a VM it did not appear to work) but
the main reason it is WIP is that adding the shortcut param may be downgrading security
and i wanted to research the details further. since this only happens on some of the computers i use, it is somewhat more difficult for me to test.
