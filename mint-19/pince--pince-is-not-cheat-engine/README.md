# PINCE

PINCE has one of those recursive acronyms that so many Linux apps do. In this case, it stands for

Pince Is Not Cheat Engine


## What is PINCE?


A Linux alternative to Cheat Engine. If you're not familiar with Cheat Engine, it is a memory hacker used to cheat at (primarily) single-player games. I do not advocate the use of cheat tools for multiplayer games except in the extremely rare case of dedicated servers where all participants are aware of and agree to their use. Using cheat tools in most multiplayer games runs the risk of getting VAC bans on your steam account and is highly discouraged.

Or we can borrow the short version from wiccans: "Don't be a dick"... er, I mean "An' ye harm none, do what ye will".


## How do I install it?


First, run `pince-setup-part-01-install-binaries-to-opt-subdir.sh` to download pince and build it from source.

Then, run `pince-setup-part-02-setup-scripts-shortcuts-and-policykit-exception.sh` to create polickykit exceptions (my understanding is that it needs to be run as root), create menu shortcuts (.desktop files), etc.


## How do I use it?


TBH, I have no idea. I rarely ever cheat in games... I created this installer because I thought my brother might be interested in PINCE if he ever migrated to Linux but I never really used PINCE; to be fair, I didn't really use CE much before I migrated to Linux either.

I'd recommend that you check out [their website](https://github.com/korcankaraokcu/PINCE) and maybe look on youtube. they also mentioned a discord server [here](https://discord.gg/KCNDp9m);
