## Description

The Fuck is a magnificent app, inspired by a @liamosaur tweet, that corrects errors in previous console commands.

See [Official Project page](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck)

This script automates the install process using pip.

## How to install:

*NOTE: This script has dependencies on resources from my repo so it will fail if you just download the install script by itself and try to run.*

To install run the following from a terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/zpangwin/linux-setup-scripts.git;
find linux-setup-scripts -type f -iname '*.sh' -exec chmod a+rx "{}" \;;
