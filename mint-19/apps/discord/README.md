WIP

maybe I'll update this to a setup script when I get back into gaming again.

The purpose of this script was that I wanted to have Discord in my startup applications (auto-starts) but I wanted it to open to the system tray rather than popping up a window and bugging me. I haven't been on discord in a while so it is possible (but I suspect unlikely) that they have fixed this issue in their application code directly. It is also possible that this script no longer works correctly or maybe there were still some window issues with this script; I don't really remember TBH. See [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/ar9mbg/linux_how_can_i_start_discord_on_login_minimized/) for details... unforunately, since its reddit the thread has been archived (I disagree with reddit's practice of locking down/archiving old posts.. at least for technical discussions).

to use, manually copy discord-to-systray.sh to /usr/bin/discord-to-systray.sh and setup your shortcuts to point to that instead of discord.
